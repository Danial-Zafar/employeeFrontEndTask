# employee

## Questions:
```
How long did you spend on this assignment? What would you have done different if you had more time?

It took me 4 and half hours to complete. If I had more time then I will add page in employee module and emplyee list component. Default home page is show the employee table an employee page should do that. I will also manage roles, initally I was not aware that each number means a role.

What are focus areas if your code would have to be part of an actual application? 
Readability, performance and scalebility of the code.
